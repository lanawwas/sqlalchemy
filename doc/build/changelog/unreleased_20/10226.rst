    :tickets: 10226

    Fixed regression which appeared in 2.0 due to :ticket:`8491` where the
    revised "ping" used for PostgreSQL dialects when the
    :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.pool_pre_ping` parameter is in use would
    interfere with the use of asyncpg with PGBouncer "transaction" mode, as the
    multiple PostgreSQL commands emitted by asnycpg could be broken out among
    multiple connections leading to errors, due to the lack of any transaction
    around this newly revised "ping".   The ping is now invoked within a
    transaction, in the same way that is implicit with all other backends that
    are based on the pep-249 DBAPI; this guarantees that the series of PG
    commands sent by asyncpg for this command are invoked on the same backend
    connection without it jumping to a different connection mid-command.  The
    transaction is not used if the asyncpg dialect is used in "AUTOCOMMIT"
    mode, which remains incompatible with pgbouncer transaction mode.
