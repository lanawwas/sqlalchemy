    Fixed the type annotation for ``__class_getitem__()`` as applied to the
    ``Visitable`` class at the base of expression constructs to accept ``Any``
    for a key, rather than ``str``, which helps with some IDEs such as PyCharm
    when attempting to write typing annotations for SQL constructs which
    include generic selectors.  Pull request courtesy Jordan Macdonald.
