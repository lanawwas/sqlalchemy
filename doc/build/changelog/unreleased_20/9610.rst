    Adjusted the operator precedence for the string concatenation operator to
    be equal to that of string matching operators, such as
    :meth:`.ColumnElement.like`, :meth:`.ColumnElement.regexp_match`,
    :meth:`.ColumnElement.match`, etc., as well as plain ``==`` which has the
    same precedence as string comparison operators, so that parenthesis will be
    applied to a string concatenation expression that follows a string match
    operator. This provides for backends such as PostgreSQL where the "regexp
    match" operator is apparently of higher precedence than the string
    concatenation operator.
